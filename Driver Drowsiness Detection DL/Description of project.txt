In this study, we present a comprehensive approach to driver drowsiness detection using the Ultralytics YOLO implementation, a robust production-ready framework built on PyTorch. 
Leveraging the base YOLO model trained on the COCO dataset with 80 different classes, we fine-tuned the model for drowsiness detection. Our method involves real-time detection using
a webcam to determine whether the driver is awake or drowsy, with potential applications in automotive safety systems. We also discuss the installation process of Ultralytics YOLO, 
labeling images in YOLO format, and the overall workflow of our approach. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of using YOLO for real-time drowsiness detection, highlighting its 
practicality and potential for implementation in various safety-critical environments. This research aims to contribute to enhancing driver safety, particularly in automotive applications.
